# Book Recommendation System ðŸ“š

This is a **Book Recommendation System** built using machine learning and deployed with **Streamlit**. It allows users to input a book title and provides similar book recommendations. Additionally, users can view book covers (if available).

## Project Overview

This system utilizes a pre-trained model and a set of book data to recommend books based on a user's input. The model works by finding the nearest neighbors of the given book in the feature space. The app is deployed and can be accessed [here](https://depi-brs.streamlit.app/).

## Features

- **Auto-completion**: Suggests book titles as you type.
- **Book Recommendations**: Returns a list of similar books.
- **Book Covers**: Displays the cover image of the recommended books (if available).
- **Customizable Recommendations**: Users can choose the number of book recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive UI built with Streamlit.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework used for deployment.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used to implement the recommendation model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: To manage and process the data.
- **PIL**: For handling book images.

## Model Details

- The system uses a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for recommendations.
- Book titles and their corresponding features are stored in a **pivot table** format to enable efficient lookups and recommendations.
- The trained model and book data are stored in the `artifacts` folder and loaded using `pickle`.
